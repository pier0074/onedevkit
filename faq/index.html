                <p>Formatting adds whitespace and indentation to make JSON readable for humans. Minifying removes all unnecessary whitespace to reduce file size. Use formatted JSON during development for readability, and minified JSON in production to reduce bandwidth and improve load times.</p>

                <p>While theoretically possible, the probability is astronomically low (about 1 in 2^122). For practical purposes, UUID collisions are considered impossible. You can safely use them as unique identifiers without worrying about duplicates.</p>

                <p>Use enough text to accurately represent the final content volume. For website mockups, 3-5 paragraphs is usually sufficient for body content. For headlines, 5-10 words work well. Match your placeholder text to realistic content lengths.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>QR codes can store various types of text-based data including URLs, plain text, phone numbers, email addresses, WiFi credentials, geographic coordinates, calendar events, and contact information (vCards). The maximum data capacity depends on the error correction level.</p>

              <summary class="faq-question">What size QR code should I use?</summary>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>For screen display, 256x256 pixels is usually sufficient. For printing, use 512x512 or larger to ensure clarity when scanned. The minimum scannable printed size is typically about 2x2 cm (0.8x0.8 inches).</p>

              <summary class="faq-question">What is error correction in QR codes?</summary>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Error correction allows QR codes to be read even if partially damaged. Level L recovers 7% of data, M recovers 15%, Q recovers 25%, and H recovers 30%. Higher levels mean larger QR codes but better reliability.</p>
