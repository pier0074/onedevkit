<h1>About OneDevKit</h1>

<section class="content-section">
  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>OneDevKit was created with a simple mission: to provide developers with free, fast, and privacy-focused tools for everyday tasks. We believe that essential developer utilities should be accessible to everyone, regardless of budget or technical expertise.</p>
  <p>Every tool on OneDevKit runs entirely in your browser. Your data never leaves your device, and we don't track, store, or sell any information you enter into our tools.</p>
</section>

<section class="content-section">
  <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
  <p>As developers ourselves, we were frustrated with existing online tools that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Required unnecessary signups or subscriptions</li>
    <li>Sent your data to remote servers</li>
    <li>Were cluttered with intrusive ads</li>
    <li>Loaded slowly with excessive JavaScript</li>
    <li>Didn't work well on mobile devices</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We set out to build the toolkit we wished existed: simple, fast, private, and free.</p>
</section>

<section class="content-section">
  <h2>Our Tools</h2>
  <p>We currently offer the following free developer tools:</p>
  <ul>
    {% for tool in tools %}
    <li><strong><a href="/tools/{{ tool.id }}/">{{ tool.fullName }}</a></strong> - {{ tool.description }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  <p>More tools are coming soon. Have a suggestion? <a href="/contact/">Let us know</a>!</p>

<section class="content-section">
  <h2>Privacy Commitment</h2>
  <p>Privacy isn't just a feature for us - it's a core principle. Here's what that means:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Client-side processing:</strong> All tools run entirely in your browser using JavaScript</li>
    <li><strong>No data collection:</strong> We don't collect, store, or transmit any data you enter</li>
    <li><strong>Minimal analytics:</strong> We only use privacy-respecting analytics for basic traffic stats</li>
    <li><strong>No third-party trackers:</strong> No social media widgets or advertising trackers</li>
    <li><strong>Open source friendly:</strong> You can inspect our code in your browser's developer tools</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Read our full <a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</p>
